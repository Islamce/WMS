# WMS Session Log

This is the chronological operational memory for the project. It records durable summaries of conversations and work, not secrets or necessarily verbatim transcripts.

## 2026-07-25 — Project memory system and authentication follow-up

**Objective:**

Prevent repeated loss of context between AI sessions and continue production recovery safely.

**Confirmed starting state:**

- Production commit: `579b5091cf99ea3c4dfa3f5531202eab546b3a88`
- Node: `v20.19.4`
- npm: `10.8.2`
- Migrations: 12 recorded, up to date
- Health endpoint: healthy
- Administrator login: failing with `Invalid email or password`
- Opening-stock reconciliation: not applied

**Actions:**

- User requested a durable reference shared by Claude and ChatGPT.
- Added mandatory AI operating instructions and project-memory documents on branch `docs/project-memory-and-runbook`.
- Recorded production safeguards, incidents, decisions, current status, and future documentation protocol.

**Next operational step:**

- Inspect the production users table schema and non-secret account fields read-only.
- Do not seed, reset accounts, or modify the database until the evidence is reviewed.

## 2026-07-25 — PR #39 deployment

**Objective:** Deploy FIFO-safe historical opening-stock date support.

**Evidence:**

- PR #39 merged.
- CI Run #145 succeeded.
- Merge/deployed commit: `579b5091cf99ea3c4dfa3f5531202eab546b3a88`
- `npm run migrate` result: `Migrations: up to date (12 recorded).`
- Health response: `{"status":"ok","service":"wms"}`

**Result:** Deployment technically healthy. Reconciliation not applied. Login failure discovered afterward.

## 2026-07-25 — Production database recovery

**Objective:** Recover production after accidental deletion of SQLite database files.

**Actions and evidence:**

- Recovered database from an open `/proc/<pid>/fd` descriptor.
- Validation copy: `/home/u716763642/wms-recovery-validation-20260725-085901/wms.db`
- Integrity and quick checks passed.
- Restored to the production path and restarted Passenger.
- Health check passed.
- Dashboard showed 9,746 materials, 1,245 empty bins, zero occupied bins, and zero stock.

**Result:** Application and database recovered; authentication follow-up remains open.

## 2026-07-23 to 2026-07-24 — Workflow, reallocation, import, and cache work

**Highlights:**

- PR #33 delivered workflow replay/recovery hardening, mobile approval parity, batch/QR traceability, migration 009, governed stock reallocation, segregation of duties, audit, notifications, replay safety, and stock/freeze revalidation.
- Production navigation initially appeared unchanged because of a stale browser asset.
- Added cache-busting query parameter to `navigation-v2.js`; user confirmed the fix worked.
- New requirements captured around durable test/real data, issue-transaction uploads, analytics inputs, and a controlled Start Fresh capability.
- Opening-stock import and historical FIFO concerns led to the later PR #39 work.

## 2026-07-20 — Notifications and offsite backup

**Highlights:**

- PR #25 notification/mobile UAT work merged.
- Firebase service account path configured with restrictive permissions.
- Android device token present for the system administrator.
- PR #26 added offsite backup automation.
- Initial Backblaze upload failed because of malformed access-key configuration.
- Credentials were corrected and a manually triggered production offsite backup completed successfully.
- Local retention decision: keep newest seven backup sets.

## 2026-07-18 and earlier — Deployment foundation

**Highlights:**

- Hostinger production established under Passenger with `app.js` leading to `server/index.js`.
- `/healthz` used for availability checks.
- Node 20 selected for compatibility with native dependencies.
- Git remote switched to SSH and authenticated successfully.
- APK build and checksum workflows established.
- Migration and deployment sequence standardized around fast-forward pull, dependency install, migrate, Passenger restart, and health validation.
